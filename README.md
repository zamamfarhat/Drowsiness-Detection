# Drowsiness-Detection (Drowsiness Detection based on RGB camera and evolving fuzzy model)
This repository contains the implementation of a real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection System designed to enhance road safety. By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning models combined with Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) for interpretability and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for optimization, this system offers a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for detecting driver fatigue in diverse and challenging conditions.

## Features
**Baseline Models:** Implements and evaluates machine learning and deep learning models such as ResNet, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, CNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
**Hybrid Models:** Enhanced versions of baseline models integrated with FIS and NAS, significantly improving detection accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.
**Real-World Adaptability:** Optimized for varying conditions, including low-light environments, occlusions, and diverse driver demographics.
**Comprehensive Visualization:** Training curves, confusion matrices, and performance metrics are provided to offer insights into model performance.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the Driver Drowsiness Dataset (DDD), which contains labeled RGB images of drivers in drowsy and non-drowsy states. The dataset has been extensively preprocessed, including normalization, augmentation, and feature extraction, to ensure high-quality inputs for the models.

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository. Please download the dataset from its official source (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailnasri20/driver-drowsiness-dataset-ddd/data)
